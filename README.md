### Hi there üëã

![2024-05-23 20-04-31](https://github.com/vitaly-zdanevich/vitaly-zdanevich/assets/3514015/436a1927-5711-484f-a2ec-5c606667d06e)


Mostly I prefer [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/vitaly-zdanevich) - because it free and open source (GitHub is [not]([url](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/))).

## Browser extensions

I spent a few years developing them - frontend and backend, one of them - [Intelligent Speaker](https://intelligent-speaker.com/), was [rewarded by Google as one of the best browser extension in 2020](https://devby.io/news/intelligent-speaker-text-to-speech).

See my lecture about browser extentions (in Russian) https://youtu.be/ybyAbTA7_Tw

## Gentoo Linux

I love Gentoo and did [a few dozen packages](https://repology.org/maintainer/zdanevich.vitaly%40ya.ru) for it, maybe can help you with an ebuild.

Also [Gentoo Wiki contributions](https://wiki.gentoo.org/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Vitaly-zdanevich&offset=&limit=500&target=Vitaly-zdanevich).
